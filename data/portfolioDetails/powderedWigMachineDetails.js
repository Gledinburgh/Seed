  "bio": "I am constantly chasing the feeling of my fingertips tingling as if they're about to snap and instantaneously produce a magic wand. Sometimes, that feeling comes to me in the middle of an intense conversation. Sometimes, it appears through consciously pulling from the remnants of a dream remembered. Sometimes, it appears when I've come to the luminous end of a hallway of thoughts. What I create exists somewhere between art films and offbeat comedies wherein a real conversation is swallowed by the fantasy afoot. The wobble of time and space right before a car crash is where my pen resides. My parents wanted a lawyer, I became musician. My parents wanted an air traffic controller, I became a talk show host. My parents wanted a stockbroker, I accidentally became a drag queen. I embrace and adore the fluidity of not only the roles that I engage but also the fluidity of inspiration.",
